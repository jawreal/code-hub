# CodeHub web-app

I created this project to serve as reference for my portfolio. This project is inspired by Stackoverflow, where you can post your programming questions and have an answer later on. It's also flexible, allowing users to create challenges to improve their knowledge regarding their selected field or programming languages. I'll also consider to add a Market section, where users can post commission and clients can rate them.
